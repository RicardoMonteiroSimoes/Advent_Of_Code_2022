# Bechmarking the solutions for each day:

The `true` parameter in each execution runs the benchmark without output, as that would spam the console.

At the same time, `I/O` is **not** part of the benchmark, only the algorithm itself. On the other hand, parsing the data from the file is done inside the benchmark. This also takes the data in raw - it does not use any form of by hand manipulation of the data into a better format.
